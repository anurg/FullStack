FAQ: What is HTML?
Ans: It is a markup language. It is used for presentation.

FAQ: How HTML presents its content?
Ans: HTML presents all its content by using a hierarchy called "DOM".
[Document Object Model].

HTML Parsing: [Translating - Converting]

```
 Markup => Bytes => Chars => Token [Tag] => Node [Element] => DOM => Layout => Render => Paint
```

Note: HTML is all about presenting DOM using various elements.
HTML elements are classified into 5 groups

```
    		1. Normal Elements
    		2. Void Elements
    		3. RC Data Elements
    		4. Raw Text Elements
    		5. Foreign Elements
```

Normal Elements:

- A normal element presents content without additional attributes.
- It starts presentation but can't stop implicitly.
- You have to stop explicitly by using end token.

```
Ex:
<b> </b>
```

Void Elements:

- The term void mean's no return value or will not return any presentation.
- Void elements will not return any presentation directly on callback.
- They require additional attributes.
- They are self ending elements, hence no end token required.

```
Ex:
<img>
```

RC Data Elements:

- Rich Content Data Elements.
- These are the elements used for plain content like text, numbers & special chars.
- They can't handle complex content.

```
Ex:
<textarea> </textarea>
```

Raw Text Elements:

- These are the elements presented by using raw text.
- They doesn't require tokens.

```
Ex:
&#8377;
&copy;
```

Foreign Elements

- These are not native to HTML.
- They are imported and used with additional library

```
Ex:
SVG, Canvas, MathML
```
